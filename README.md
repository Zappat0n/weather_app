## About the Project

This project is taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

In this application, Users can:
- Ask for the weather in any city of the world
- Get information about the weather, temperature and wind.
- Temperature information can be displayed in Celsius or Farenheit.

The application does an API query to OpenWeatherMap to get the information.
